Project ToDo List
At the moment the program is runable. It is able to add, view, and delete tasks in the list.

Future Feature:
In the future, I will add the option to move tasks in between the list. This will allow the user
to prioritize some tasks in the list. A reorganize option will be added to remove the empty tasks in the list if the user chooses.
