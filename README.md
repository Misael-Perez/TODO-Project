Project ToDo List
At the moment the program is runable. It is able to add, view, and delete tasks in the list.

Future Feature:
In the future, I will add the option to move tasks in between the list. This will allow the user
to prioritize some tasks in the list. A reorganize option will be added to remove the empty tasks in the list if the user chooses.

Update (10-14-2024):
I added a organization command that will allow the user to get rid of empty task. It is mostly to complement the delete command, which leaves a task empty. In addition, you can now edit the list, and the output is more visually pleasing. 

Future Features:
Will add a GUI rather than a command line. But before that, I will try to make it take strings as inputs. Might use Java for GUI.
